\begin{abstract}
    \noindent
    [ This literature review investigates the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in advancing software testing, with particular emphasis on various AI methodologies, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), and their application in automating and optimizing software testing processes. The review synthesizes insights from four key papers that examine the utilization of LLMs, AI-driven testing tools, and Machine Learning (ML) to address limitations in conventional testing practices. The findings reveal that although AI techniques substantially reduce manual effort and enhance test accuracy, they also introduce new challenges, such as algorithmic uncertainty and the incomprehensibility of models. The review concludes that while AI has the potential to revolutionize software testing, further research is required to fully integrate AI into diverse testing environments and to bridge the existing methodological gaps. ]

    \textbf{Figure 7} shows an overfit model. It performs extremely accurately on the training data and fits every training data point almost perfectly, but the problem is that this complex curve is just "memorizing" the noise of the training data. When the model encounters new data (indicated by the blue question mark in the figure), its predictions may be wrong because the model cannot generalize to situations outside the training data. Although the error of the overfit model on the training data is small, the performance will drop sharply on the test data or actual application.\\
    \vspace{2em}
    \text The model shown in Figure 6 is more accurate because it balances the performance of training data and test data well and avoids overfitting. Although there is a small amount of error, it can generalize to unseen data and provide more stable predictions. The overfit model in Figure 7 performs perfectly on the training data, but performs poorly on new data, indicating that it is too complicated to effectively cope with real-world data changes. Therefore, the model in Figure 6 is more reliable in practical applications.
